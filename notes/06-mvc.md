# MVC

        mvcs = view(what the user sees and the html structure), controller(takes in the actions for the user, draws information to the dom), service (this is where the logic happens), appstate, and model

        new is a keyword used to indicate that there is a new item with the class

        REMEMBER         App.js is where we will collect all the info for our app
        


          in the mvcs model it is usually best to start witht eh 'character' models to begin the project
                then we will want to update the appstate and inport the character 'model' or the class we made into the apps state file
                        then we will set up the controller

          this symbol || represents an 'or' opererator that will make a decision between a group of items, if the options are an undefined or null value vrs a string or num they will take in the data that it will read.
