# Weekly Reflection
The first lab was a challenge for sure. In the lecture I felt fairly confident and able to tackle the lab, perhaps this is the unconscious ignorance that was talked about day one. After the lab I definitely felt the conscious ignorance. Though I do feel good that the next lecture is going to enlighten us with bootstrap. // end 11/14 // the biggest challenge for me today was figuring out the background image, some notes for me. be mindful of the height and width of the image when I copy the url. The image link can also not be allowed to run on a local host so its important to look out for that as well.  Generally, I feel slightly flustered that I feel like I am not as fast (yet) in creating and cloning these websites. I think that I can fix this by continuing to work hard and to study bootstrap and its capabilities. Though, it was comforting to know that as far as the structure or framework of the website I understand slightly about how container-flex, rows, and columns function.
