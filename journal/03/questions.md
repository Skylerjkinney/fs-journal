01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, 

  Abstraction = to abstract something means to hide away the implementation details inside something - sometimes a prototype, sometimes a function. Basically when you call the function you don't have to understand exactly what it is doing. That is what Abstraction is all about. Finding things that are similar in your code and providing a generic function or object to serve multiple places/with multiple concerns.
 
 Encapsulation = the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule. Encapsulation means that each object in your code should control its own state. State is the current "snapshot" of your object. The keys, the methods on your object, Boolean properties and so on. If you were to rest a Boolean or delete a key from the object, they're all changes to your state.
 
Inheritance = lets the object acquire the properties and methods of another object. keep your inheritance simple and predictable. Remember the Liskov substitution principle. 

Polymorphism =
