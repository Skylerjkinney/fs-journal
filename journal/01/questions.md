# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use Git for that we can save, upload and download different files. The reason we use this is so that we can edit view and modify different files of code in different states. We use this so that we have different versions of a file just in case a new line of code has an adverse affect. It is also very nice to use when you are working collaboratively with other people.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > The `mkdir` command stands for make directory. we use this to create a new folder or directory to put our files of code into!

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo-class is a keyword in css that you would attach to an anchor element in order to change the anchor element when the anchor element is intended to be in a special state. For instance, if we were to have a button element that we wanted to lighten the color of while the cursor is hovering over it, we can use the pseudo-class "hover". The pseudo-classes I believe that we will use a lot are hover, target, and most likely required for when we make forms.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > specificity is an algorithm that calculate a weight that is applied to a given css declaration. its weight is determined by adding the values in each selectors class. we can use this by attaching things like pseudo-classes to elements to apply the css elements we will make or have made. Make the things look good.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    >One of the first issues i see with the feature is that it overrides all animations in css. It also will take something like 'background' which is a shorthand property, it will take all of the subclasses of background and also consider them !important.  Important declarations reverse the order of precedence. So the user end layer takes precedence over everything up to the user end layer.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```
