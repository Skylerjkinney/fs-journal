# Weekly Reflection
I absolutely feel more confident this week moving into javaScript. The biggest struggles I face is understanding the design aspect of web development. Though i believe that over time I will pick it up and right now its more important for me to focus on the functionality of my projects. I also have been enjoying the firesides/whiteboard challenges and i feel like the content there has been positive for me. I need to make sure I understand the importance of aliasing out variables in order to "move" around my data. Something I learned that came to me as a surprise is the how we can use intervals to run a function at a set time that repeats. Super cool. I feel like this week overall can be considered a success.
