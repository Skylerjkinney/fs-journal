# Weekly Reflection
The first lab was a challenge for sure. In the lecture I felt fairly confident and able to tackle the lab, perhaps this is the unconscious ignorance that was talked about day one. After the lab I definitely felt the conscious ignorance. Though I do feel good that the next lecture is going to enlighten us with bootstrap. // end 11/14



This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
