# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > synchronous code performs one action at a time and all other functions will remain idle while the one function is finished. In comparison asynchronous code will perform all the actions at the same time and will finish quickly.
  synchronous code = slow
  asynchronous = fast  

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener is a function that "watches" something an when something triggers on the thing that is listened too then something happens. Typically an function called a "handler".

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable and scalable distributed systems.
  In simple terms it means that it is a standardized way we handle client/server interactions and don't break the internet.
  similar to HTTP is RESTful or RESTful API

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result
  its a function that can run multiple functions
  a callback function is the function that is called from the higher order function to handle the a

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > A promise was the javascript solution to call back hell where there was just a cascading mess of indents and higher order functions because things need to run in async. Promises serve to solve this by having a function have two parameters that will either resolve or reject the parameters are functions that indicate completion or failure in asynchronous code.
