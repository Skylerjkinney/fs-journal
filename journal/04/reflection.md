# Weekly Reflection
Apis have been an interesting topic to begin to learn about. Although they do seem a little tedious at times they certainly are going to be a resource i use quite often. I feel much more confident this week in my abilities to understand and produce code and I find myself being able to write small bits of code from memory so I feel like I am beginning to conceptually understand the content a bit better. I am a little confused in what are the requirements of bringing in different forms of data from different apis. I know we can use the "||" to state an or statement if the data is going to come in undefined. There is much more for me to learn about APIs but I am excited to keep growing and become more confident in using them.
